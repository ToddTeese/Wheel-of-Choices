            <h3>Why Make This?</h3>

            <p>
                Making decisions from a group of options can sometimes be a pain. This is meant to make making decisions quick and fun.

                That working with circles is a pain. But seriously, this project has been a good insight into a class based approach to breaking down objects.
                The wheel is constructed of wheel segments, by doing this it makes the addition/removal of wheel segments easier. It also helps to identify 
                the segments by name and color, allowing for a smoother transition from user input to visual display.

            <p>I also need to add scaling for phones.</p>
